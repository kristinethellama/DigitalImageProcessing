Hello Dr. Yfantis!

How to build my project:
I have a visual c++ dll that contains the server/client code and my front end is build in c#.
I need you to build the dll project first to get those functions in use. 
Then you can be able to build normally with the other two project files of the UI part.

How to run my project:
The buttons are in order so for server side, start, record, stop is normal.
START THE SERVER FIRST, then on the client side, START CLIENT
go back to server UI and click send to client
on client side, click recieve
close server
press display video and it should have an open file dialog --- the recording and the RESULT (what was recieved by S/C) should exist in a created "temp" folder inside
your C drive
finally you can close the client and be able to exit applications


Thank you so much for this semester! This class was able to challenge me intellectually in many ways :)
Stay safe professor!
